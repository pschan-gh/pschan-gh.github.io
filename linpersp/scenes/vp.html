        Let $\vec{n}_0$ be a normal vector of the Picture Plane.
        Let $L$ be a non-orthogonal (to the Picture Plane)
        line parallel to a nonzero vector $\vec{v}$
        There is a unique plane $\mathcal{P}$ containing $L$ and perpendicular to the Picture Plane.
        It has a normal vector defined as follows:
        \[
        \vec{n} = \vec{v} \times \vec{n}_0.
        \]
        This is the ground plane associated with the line.
        <br />
        (Under this framework, orthogonal lines have no grounds.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Let $G$ be the line which is the intersection of $\mathcal{P}$ and the Picture Plane.
        We call it the <em>ground line</em> of $L$.
    </p>
    <p>
        This plane has a vanishing line $H$, which is the unique line on the Picture Plane which
        passes through the center point $C$ and is parallel to $G$. We call this line $H$ the <em>horizontal</em> of
        $L$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two lines which has the same horizontal are said to be <em>co-horizontal</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vanishing points of all co-horizontal lines lie on the same horizontal on the Picture Plane.
