    <h3>Perspectival Projection</h3>
    <div class="section1">
        <p>
            Given an observing "eyeball" $O$, we choose a <em>picture plane</em> $\Pi$ at a fixed distance from $O$.
        </p>
        <p>
            For any point $P$ in space, on either side of $\Pi$, we define the <strong>seat</strong>
            of $P$ to be the unique point $P^{\dagger}$ on $\Pi$
            such that the line segment $\overline{P^{\dagger}P}$ is perpendicular to $\Pi$. This point
            always exists because any line which is not parallel to a plane must intersect that plane at
            a unique point.
        </p>
        <p>
            We denote by $Z$ the seat of $O$. We call it the <strong>center</strong> of $\Pi$.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let $A$ be any point in space on the other side of the picture plane $\Pi$ from $O$.
            Its <strong>perspectival projection</strong> $A'$ is by definiton the unique point where
            the line passing through $A$ and $O$ intersects $\Pi$.
            Let $A^{\dagger}$ denote the seat of $A$.
        </p>
        <div class="default"></div>
        <p>
            If $\overline{OA}$ is perpendicular to $\Pi$, then
            then $A' = Z$, since there is exactly one unique line passing through $O$
            which is perpendicular to $\Pi$.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume now that $\overline{OA}$ is not perpendicular to $\Pi$.
            We claim that $O, Z, A, A'$, and $A^{\dagger}$ all belong to the same plane.
            To see this, observe that by assumption the points $O, Z, A$
            are non-colinear (i.e. not all on the same line).
            It is known that any three non-colinear points determine a unique
            plane containing all three. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the plane which contains
            $O, Z, A$. Since $\overline{AA^{\dagger}}$ and $\overline{OZ}$ are both
            perpendicular to $\Pi$, they are parallel to each other.
            This implies that $A^{\dagger}$ lies on $\mathcal{P}$.
        </p>
        <div class="seat"></div>
        <p>
            Moreover, since $\mathcal{P}$ contains the line segment $\overline{OZ}$
            which is perpendicular to $\Pi$,
            the point $\mathcal{P}$ cannot be parallel to $\Pi$. Hence,
            $\mathcal{P}$ intersects $\Pi$ at a unique line $\mathbf{K}$.
            Since $Z$ and $A^{\dagger}$ belong to both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\Pi$,
            they must both lie on $\mathbf{K}$. Since $Z \neq A^{\dagger}$, it follows that
            $\mathbf{K}$ is the unique line passing through $Z$ and $A^{\dagger}$.
            Since $A'$ by definition must lie on $\Pi$ and also on $\overline{OA}$,
            which lies on $\mathcal{P}$, the point $A'$ must belong to the intersection of $\mathcal{P}$
            and $\Pi$.
            Hence, $A'$ lies in the intersection of $\overline{OA}$ and $\mathbf{K}$.
            Since $\mathbf{K}$ lies on $\Pi$, and $\overline{OA}$ intersects $\Pi$
            at exactly one point, the intersection of $\overline{OA}$ and $\mathbf{K}$
            consists of $A'$ alone.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            From Euclidean geometry (i.e. "school geometry"), the triangles $\Delta OA'Z$
            and $\Delta AA'A^{\dagger}$ are similar.  -->
        <!-- Hence, $A'$ is the unique point on the line segment
            $\overline{ZA^{\dagger}}$ such that:
            \[
            \frac{\abs{\overline{ZA'}}}{\abs{\overline{A^{\dagger}A'}}}
            =
            \frac{\abs{\overline{OZ}}}{\abs{\overline{A^{\dagger}A}}}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, the position of $A'$ may be uniquely determined from the location of the seat
            of $A$ and the distance of $A$ from $\Pi$.
        </p> -->
    </div>
    <div class="section2">
        <p>
            In practice, the point $A'$ may be found on the picture plane as follows:
            First, find the seat $A^{\dagger}$ on $\Pi$.
            Then, draw the line $\mathbf{K}$ through the points $Z$ and $A^{\dagger}$.
            Draw a point $O^{\ast}$ on $\Pi$ such that the distance between $O^{\ast}$
            and the center $Z$ is equal to that between $O$ and $Z$. Next, draw a point $A^{\ast}$
            on $\Pi$, on the other side of $\overline{OA^{\dagger}}$ from $O^{\ast}$,
            such that the distance between $A^{\dagger}$ and $A^{\ast}$ is equal to that between
            $A$ and $\Pi$ (or, equivalently, the length of $\overline{A^{\dagger}A})$.
        </p>
        <p>
            Draw the line segment $\overline{O^{\ast}A^{\ast}}$. Where this line segment intersects
            $\mathbf{K}$ is the location of $A'$, the perspectival projection of the point $A$.
        </p>
        <div class="rotateStar"></div>
        <p>
            (Essentially, we are rotating the plane containing $O, Z, A, A'$ and $A^{\dagger}$
            about the line $\mathbf{K}$ by 90 degrees.)
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, it may be shown that $A'$ always lie within the line segment
            $\overline{ZA^{\dagger}}$, so in practice one could have drawn $\overline{ZA^{\dagger}}$ instead of
            $\mathbf{K}$.
        </p>
    </div>

        Alternatively, one could fix a frame of reference, and a suitably normalized unit of measurement,
        so that the observer eyeball corresponds to the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ in Cartesian space and the picture plane
        corresponds
        to the plane defined by the equation $x = 1$. In such a setup, the perspectival projection of any point
        in 3-dimensional space
        with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ is simply $(1, y/x, z/x)$ provided that $x \neq 0$.
        <!-- (Curiously, this projection
        could be defined even if the point is on the <em>same side</em> of the picture plane as the observer.) If the
        $x$-coordinate of the point in question is equal to $0$,
        then the point has no perspectival projection. -->
    </p>
    <p>
        In principle, this is all one needs to render images in linear perspective, especially with the help of
        modern computing technology.

        Without the aid of such tools, finding the perspectival projection
        of more complicated objects point-by-point in a purely computational manner could be tedious,
        and it is useful to develop a set of laws which describe how higher order geometric objects
        like lines, ellipses and cubes, etc, transform under perspectival projection.
        <!-- not to mention a tendency of such an approach to obfuscate deeper geometric truths, leading one to miss
        the forest for the trees, so to speak. -->
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        For a deeper understanding of the geometric principles involved,
        it is worthwhile to examine the laws governing the perspectival projection
        of higher order geometric objects such as lines, ellipses, cube, etc.
    </p> -->
    <div class="section2">
        <p>
            One of the most important of these laws concerns the perspectival projection of
            straight lines.
            In other words, viewing a line or line segment as a collection of infinitely many points,
            what does the set of perspectival projections
            of all these points look like? Is it a line, part of a line, or something else entirely?

        There two types of lines to consider: <strong>Transversals</strong> and <strong>Non-Transversals</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="section1">
        <p>
            By definition, a transversal line is a line which is parallel to the picture plane.
            For any transveral line $\mathbf{L}$,
            its perspectival projection is the intersection of $\Pi$ with the unique plane which
            contains
            both $O$ and $\mathbf{L}$.
            In particular, the projection is a line on $\Pi$ which is parallel to the original line.
        </p>
        <div class="transversal"></div>
        <p>
            For any two points $A$ And $B$ on a transversal line, its follows from Euclidean geometry
            that the distance between their perspectival projections $A'$ and $B'$
            is equal to the distance between $A$ and $B$ divided by a fixed factor $s$ defined as follows:
            \[
            s = 1 + \frac{\text{distance between transversal line and $\Pi$}}
            {\text{distance between the observer and $\Pi$}}
            \]
        </p>
        <div class="transversalMove"></div>
        <p>
            Notice that this factor $s$ is independent of the position of $A$ and $B$ on the transversal line. This
            implies
            that
            there is no distortion in the perspectival projection of a transversal line, in the sense that evenly spaced
            points
            on the transversal line (e.g. points on a ruler) project to evenly spaced points on $\Pi$.
            This is a useful fact to be exploited later in the discussion of measuring points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, if the transversal line happens to lie on the picture plane, then $s = 1$,
            which makes sense since in this case the line is the same as its own perspectival projection.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section2">
        <p>
            The second type of lines we consider are the non-transversal lines, namely lines
            which are not parallel to the picture plane.
            <!-- Generally speaking, the perspectival projection of such a line is a "half-line" on the picture plane.
            In the sense that one end of the line terminates at a "vanishing point." -->
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            In the special case where the non-transveral line happens to pass through the eyeball $O$,
            its perspectival projection is just a single point,
            namely the unqiue point where it intersects the picture plane.
            This point may also be called its vanishing point.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            <strong>We will explore how to find the vanishing point of non-transveral line,
                and why the perspectival projection of non-transverals terminate at their vanishing points.</strong>
        </p> -->
        <p>
            Given any non-transversal line $\mathbf{L}$, we define the <strong>directional</strong> of $\mathbf{L}$
            to be the unique line $\mathbf{D}$ passing through $O$ which is parallel to $\mathbf{L}$.
            (Brook Taylor called $\mathbf{D}$ the <em>parallel of the original line</em> $\mathbf{L}$.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Since $\mathbf{L}$ is by assumption not transversal, neither is $\mathbf{D}$. So, $\mathbf{D}$ intersects
            the
            picture plane at a unique point $V$. We call this point $V$ the <strong>vanishing point</strong> of
            $\mathbf{L}$.

                Let $A$ be any point on $\mathbf{L}$ on the other side of the picture plane from $O$.
                If $\mathbf{L}$ passes through $O$, then $B = V$, and the "line segment" $\overline{VB}$ is just the
                point
                $V$.

            <p>
                From now on, suppose $\mathbf{L}$ does not pass through $O$.
                Linear algebra tells us that there is a unique plane $\mathcal{P}$ which contains both the point $O$
                and the line $\mathbf{L}$. Moreover, since $\mathbf{L}$ is non-transversal, $\mathcal{P}$ is not
                parallel
                to $\Pi$, so the the intersection of these two planes is a line $\mathbf{L}'$.
                <!-- (This result, though possibly intuitive, is not completely trivial,
                but in any event it does follow from basic linear algebra.) -->
                By construction,
                the line segment $\overline{VB}$ contains both the point $V$ and the point $B$. Since $V$ and $B$
                both lie on $\Pi$ and $\mathcal{P}$, they both lie on $\mathbf{L}'$. Hence, $\overline{VB}$
                is part of $\mathbf{L}'$.
            </p>
            <p>
                By definition, the perspectival projection $A'$ of $A$ must lie on the line segment
                $\overline{OA}$, which in turn lies on $\mathcal{P}$.
                Moreover, since $A'$ is the unique point where $\overline{OA}$ intersects $\Pi$,
                it must belong to $\mathbf{L}'$, the intersection of these two planes.
            </p>
            <p>
                It remains to show why $A'$ lies on the line segment $\overline{VB}$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since $A'$ lies on the line segment $\overline{OA}$,
                we have:
                \[
                \overrightarrow{A'A} = \alpha \overrightarrow{A'O}\\
                \]
                for some number $\alpha \lt 0$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since $\mathbf{L}$ is parallel to $\overline{OV}$,
                \[
                \overrightarrow{BA} = \beta \overrightarrow{VO},
                \]
                for some $\beta \lt 0$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise,
                \[
                \overrightarrow{A'B} = \gamma \overrightarrow{A'V}
                \]
                for some number $\gamma$. The sign of $\gamma$ will tell us whether
                $A'$ lies "between" $V$ and $B$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since:

                \end{align*}
                we have:

                \overrightarrow{A'B}
                &=\overrightarrow{A'A} - \overrightarrow{BA}\\
                \overrightarrow{A'V} &=\overrightarrow{A'O} -
                \overrightarrow{VO}\\

            <p>
                It follows that:
                \[
                \vec{0} = (\gamma - \alpha)\overrightarrow{A'O} - (\gamma - \beta)\overrightarrow{VO}\\
                \]
                Since $\overrightarrow{A'O}$ and $\overrightarrow{VO}$ are not parallel
                (hence <em>linearly independent</em>),
                we have must have:
                \[
                \gamma - \alpha = \gamma - \beta = 0.
                \]
                So, $\gamma = \alpha \lt 0$, implying that
                the vectors $\ora{A'V}$ and $\ora{A'B}$ point in opposite directions.
                Hence, it follows that $A'$ lies on the line segment $\overline{VB}$ between
                the points $V$ and $B$.

                Moreover, since by assumption $A'$ is strictly between $V$ and $B$,

                \gamma\ora{VO} &= \alpha\ora{A'O} - \beta\ora{A'V}\\
                \ora{VO} &= \ora{A'O} - \ora{A'V},
                \end{align*}
                which implies that:
                \[
                (\gamma - \beta)\ora{VO} = - (\alpha - \beta)\ora{A'O}.
                \]
                Since $\ora{VO} \nparallel \ora{VO}$, both $\gamma - \beta$ and $\alpha - \beta$
                must be equal to $0$. In particular, $\gamma = \beta \lt 0,$ which implies that
                $A$ is on the opposite side of the picture plane from $O$. We conclude that
                $A'$ is the perspectival projection of a point $A$ on $\mathbf{L}$.

    <h3>Finding the Vanishing Point on the Picture Plane</h3>
    <div class="section1">
        <p>
            If the line $\mathbf{L}$ is orthogonal to the picture plane, then its directional $\mathbf{D}$
            is also orthogonal to $\Pi$. The vanishing point $V$ in this case coincides with the so-called
            center point $Z$ of $\Pi$,
        <div class="orthogonal"></div>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            Now, consider any non-transveral line $\mathbf{L}$ which is not orthogonal to $\Pi$.
            To find the vanishing point $V$ of $\mathbf{L}$, it is useful to consider how $\mathbf{L}$ deviates
            from being orthogonal to $\Pi$, in the following sense:

    <!-- <div class="section1"> -->
    <p>
        Before we continue with finding the vanishing point for any non-transversal line $\mathbf{L}$.
        It is useful to first establish the following results:
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <b>Theorem.</b>
        Let $\mathcal{Q}$ be any plane in space which is not parallel to the picture plane.
        Then, there exists a line $\mathbf{H}$ on $\Pi$ such that
        the perspectival projection of $\mathcal{Q}$ terminates at $\mathbf{H}$,
        in the sense that the vanishing point of any nontransversal line $\mathbf{N}$ parallel to
        $\mathcal{Q}$ must lie on $\mathbf{H}$.

        <strong>Proof.</strong>
    </a>
    <div id="proofvl" class="collapse theorem">
        Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the unique plane containing $O$ which is parallel to $\mathcal{Q}$.
        Let $\mathbf{H}$ be the intersection of $\mathcal{H}$ and the picture plane.
        <!-- Pick any two parallel lines $\mathbf{L}_1$, $\mathbf{L}_2$ which lie on $\mathcal{Q}$, corresponding to

            of the two lines intersect the picture plane.
            <br /> -->
        Given any line $\mathbf{J}$ which is parallel to $\mathcal{Q}$, its directional $\mathbf{D}$
        passes through $O$ and is parallel to $\mathbf{H}$. Hence, $\mathbf{D}$ lies on $\mathcal{H}$.
        By definition, the vanishing point of $\mathbf{J}$ is the point where $\mathbf{D}$ intersects
        $\Pi$.
        Since by construction the line $\mathbf{H}$ is the intersection of
        $\mathcal{H}$ and $\Pi$,
        it follows that the vanishing point of $\mathbf{J}$ lies on $\mathbf{H}$.
    </div>
    <p>
        Also, by construction,
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        <b>Corollary.</b>
        The line $\mathbf{H}$ is parallel to the intersection of $\mathcal{Q}$ with $\Pi$.
    </div>
    <p>
        We call this line $\mathbf{H}$ the <strong>vanishing line</strong> of the plane $\mathcal{Q}$.
        It may be shown that any two planes which are parallel to each other, but not parallel to $\Pi$,
        have the same vanishing line.

        In the common situation where the observer has fixed a frame of reference giving meaning to such
        qualities as "vertical" and "horizontal"
        (notice that these terms have never been used so far in our discussion),
        the vanishing line of any horizontal plane is precisely the <strong>horizon</strong>
        discussed in most introductory texts on linear perspective.

            Now, back to the non-transveral line $\mathbf{L}$.
            Let $V$ be the vanishing point of $\mathbf{L}$.
            Let $B$ be the point where $\mathbf{L}$ intersects $\Pi$.
            Let $\mathbf{K}$ be the line orthogonal to $\Pi$ which intersects $\mathbf{L}$
            at the point $B$. (In fact, any other point
            on $\mathbf{L}$ will work just fine. We just need to fix a point for our demonstration.)
            Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the unique plane containing $B$
            which is parallel to both $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{L}$.
            Let's call $\mathcal{G}$ the <strong>ground plane</strong> of $\mathbf{L}$.
        </p>
        <div class="groundPlane"></div>
        <p>
            (Note that if $\mathbf{L}$ is orthogonal to $\Pi$, then $\mathbf{L}$
            is equal to $\mathbf{K}$.
            In this case, there are infinitely many planes containing $\mathbf{L}$ which are orthogonal to the
            $\Pi$.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Let $\mathbf{H}$ be the vanishing line of $\mathcal{G}$.
            Let $\mathbf{G}$ be the line which is the intersection of $\mathcal{G}$ and $\Pi$.
            Then, by the theorems above, the line $\mathbf{H}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{G}$.
            Moreover, both the center point $Z$ and the vanishing point $V$ lie on $\mathbf{H}$,
            since they are the vanishing points of lines, $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{L}$, respectively,
            which are parallel to $\mathcal{G}$.
        </p>
        <p>
            We call the lines $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ the
            <strong>horizon</strong> and <strong>ground line</strong>, respectively,
            associated with $\mathbf{L}$.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be shown that every point on $\mathbf{G}$ is the seat of a point on $\mathbf{L}$.
            Hence, we call $\mathbf{G}$ the <strong>seat</strong> of $\mathbf{L}$.
            To find $\mathbf{H}$ in practice, we first find the seat $\mathbf{G}$ of $\mathbf{L}$
            on $\Pi$, then translate $\mathbf{G}$ without altering its direction so that it passes
            through $Z$. This shifted $\mathbf{G}$ is equal to $\mathbf{H}$.

        <div class="groundLine"></div>

    <div class="section1">
        <p>
            Let $\delta$ be the ($\leq 90^\circ$) angle between $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{L}$. Then, the angle between
            the
            line segments $\overline{OZ}$ and $\overline{OV}$ is also $\delta$. To find the location of
            $V$ on the horizon $\mathbf{H}$, imagine rotating the triangle $\Delta ZOV$ about $\mathbf{H}$
            by 90 degrees. Then, $O$ is transformed to a point $\hat{O}$ on $\Pi$ whose distance
            to $Z$ is equal to that between $O$ and $Z$, and the angle between $\overline{\hat{O}Z}$ and
            $\overline{\hat{O}V}$ is also equal to $\delta$.
        </p>
        <div class="rotate"></div>
        <p>
            Hence, once the horizon $\mathbf{H}$ associated with $\mathbf{L}$ has been determined,
            one can find the location of $V$ this way:
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, draw a point $\hat{O}$ on $\Pi$ such that
                $\overline{\hat{O}Z}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{H}$,
                and the distance between $\hat{O}$
                and $Z$ is equal to that between $O$ and $Z$.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, draw a line through $\hat{O}$ such that the angle between the line and $\overline{\hat{O}Z}$
                is $\delta$. Where this line intersects $\mathbf{H}$ is the vanishing point $V$ of $\mathbf{L}$.
