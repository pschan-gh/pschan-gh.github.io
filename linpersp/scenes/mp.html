        Let $\mathbf{L}$ be an non-transversal line, and $\mathbf{L}'$ its perspectival projection on the picture plane.
    </p>
    <p>
        (From henceforth,
        the perspectival projection of any object will be labelled by affixing the
        $\prime$ symbol to the label of the original object.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Let $\mathbf{J}$ (the "ruler") be any transversal line passing through point $A$
        which is not parallel to $\mathbf{L}'$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let $B$ be any point on $\mathbf{J}$.
        Its perspectival projection on the picture plane is the point $B'$ on $\mathbf{J}'$ such that:
        \[
        \frac{\left|\overline{A'B'}\right|}{\left|\overline{AB}\right|}
        =
        \frac{\left|\overline{OA'}\right|}{\left|\overline{OA}\right|}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Let $C$ be a point on the line $\mathbf{L}$ which has the same distance to $A$
        as $B$.
        <strong>This document addresses the problem of finding $C'$.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We define the <strong>directional</strong> of $\mathbf{L}$ to be the line through $O$ which is parallel
        to $\mathbf{L}$.
        The <strong>vanishing point</strong> $V$ of $\mathbf{L}$ is the point where the directional of $\mathbf{L}$
        intersects the picture plane.
    <p>
    <p>
        We take the <strong>measuring line</strong> $\mathbf{K}$ to be the unique
        line passing through $V$ which is parallel to $\mathbf{J}$.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        With regard to finding $C'$, there are two cases to consider:
    </p>
    <div style="margin:10px 5px;padding:20px;border-radius:10px;background-color:#def">
        <strong>Case 1:
            The point $C$ is closer to the picture plane than the base point $A$.
        </strong>
        <p>
            In this case, we take $M$ to be the point on $\mathbf{K}$ of distance
            $\left|\overline{OV}\right|$ to $V$, which lies on the "same side" of $\mathbf{L}'$
            as $B'$.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the triangle $\Delta VMO$ is an isoceles triangle, just like $\Delta ABC$.
            Moreover, by construction:
            \[
            \overline{VM} \parallel \overline{AB} \quad \text{ and } \quad
            \overline{VO} \parallel \overline{AC}
            \]
            Hence, from school geometry the triangle $\Delta ABC$ is similar to $\Delta VMO$.
            In fact, stronger than similar:
            each pair of corresponding sides of the two triangles are parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular:
            \[
            \overline{OM} \parallel \overline{CB}
            \]
            which implies that the point $M$ coincides with the vanishing point of $\overline{CB}$.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin:10px 5px;padding:20px;border-radius:10px;background-color:#dee">
        <strong>Case 2:
            The point $C$ is further from the picture plane than the base point $A$.
        </strong>
        <p>
            In this case, let $\tilde{C}$ be the point on the directional of $\mathbf{L}$
            which is on the other side of the picture plane from $O$,
            such that $\left|\overline{OC}\right| = \left|\overline{OV}\right|$.
        </p>
        <p>
            By essentially the same reasoning used in Case 1, the triangle $\Delta V\tilde{B}\tilde{C}$
            is similar to $\Delta ABC$, with parallel corresponding sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take $M$ to be the reflection of $\tilde{B}$ over the point $V$.
            Then, $\Delta VMO$ is the reflection of $\Delta V\tilde{B}\tilde{C}$ through $V$,
            and hence:
            \[
            \overline{OM} \parallel \overline{BC}.
            \]
            This implies that $M$ is the vanishing point of the line segment $\overline{BC}$.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practical terms, $M$ is the point on $\mathbf{K}$ of distance
            $\left|\overline{OV}\right|$ to $V$, which lies on the "opposite side" of $\mathbf{L}'$
            as $B'$.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        We call the point $M$ the <strong>measuring point</strong> of the line $\mathbf{L}$.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>In either case,</strong>
        <br />
        since $C$ lies on the line segment $\overline{BC}$,
        its perspectival projection $C'$
        lies on the line passing through $B'$ and $M$.

        On the other hand, since $C$ also lies on $\mathbf{L}$, the point $C'$
        must also lie on $\mathbf{L}'$. So,
        <strong>$C'$ must be the unique intersection
            of the line segment $\overline{B'M}$ with $\mathbf{L}'$.

        <strong>Remark:</strong>
        <br />
        Note that the ruler $\mathbf{J}'$ can be taken to be any line different from $\mathbf{L}'$
        passing through the base point $A$, as long as the condition $\mathbf{J}' \parallel \mathbf{K}$ is
        maintained.
